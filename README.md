# Lunar Lander Game

Use joystick, Wii Nunchuck or keys to safely land your ship on the moon's landing pads.

Keep you approach speed low or you will crash!

There are 10 levels to explore.

Don't run out of fuel!

See whether you can beat your best score, or maybe just tackle some difficult caves...

For each level completed, you receive a secret code for the next level. On the menu screen, press the keys in order, and keeping them pressed.
